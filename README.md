## Overview

Chatballs takes over the first line of customer conversations. An AI agent answers from your knowledge base in Telegram, MAX, VK, email and the chat on your website. When the agent is not confident or the customer asks for a person, the conversation goes to your team together with a notification.

The platform installs on your own server with a single command. Customer data stays with you. You connect the AI model with your own key.

---

## Installation

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Server** | Linux, x86_64 |
| **Software** | Docker with the Docker Compose plugin |
| **Ports** | 80 and 443 open |
| **Ports for calls** | 3478 (UDP and TCP) and the UDP range 49160–49999 |

A domain is not needed to start. The installation opens by the server's IP address; the domain is set later in the settings.

### Step 1. Start the stack

Download `compose.yaml` from the release page and bring the stack up:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/dartdavros/chatballs/releases/latest/download/compose.yaml -o compose.yaml
```

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Nothing else needs to be configured. There is no `.env` file: instance secrets are generated on first start and kept in a Docker volume. Everything else is configured in the UI.

What happens on first start:

1. Instance secrets are generated: signing key, database role passwords, encryption key, TURN secret.
2. PostgreSQL with pgvector and Redis start.
3. Database migrations run.
4. The application, background worker, frontend and Caddy gateway start.

### Step 2. First-run wizard

Open `http://<server IP>/` in a browser. The wizard asks for:

- the organization name;
- the owner's name, email and password;
- whether to install demo data to explore the product on an example.

You are then signed in as the owner.

### Step 3. Configure in the UI

Everything else is done in **Settings**.

| Section | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Set the installation domain. The gateway issues a Let's Encrypt certificate on its own and switches to HTTPS. Outgoing SMTP mail is configured here as well: it is needed for employee invitations and password recovery. |
| **Integrations** | Connect an AI model provider: OpenRouter, any OpenAI-compatible service or a local model. A demo provider that needs no key is available for a first look. Then connect entry points: a Telegram bot, a MAX bot, a VK community, a mailbox over IMAP/SMTP or a web widget for your site. |
| **Agents** | Create an AI agent: who it is, how it speaks, what rules it follows. Choose the model. Attach articles from the knowledge base. |
| **Employees** | Invite your team by email, assign roles and groups. |

The home screen shows a launch checklist: create an agent, connect an entry point, invite employees.

### Website widget

After creating a web widget, add one tag to your site:

```html
<script src="https://<your domain>/chat-widget.js" data-widget-key="<widget key>" async></script>
```

The chat opens in an isolated window on top of the site.

### Calls

Calls work right after the installation. Between browsers the conversation goes directly; when one side sits behind strict NAT or on a VPN it goes through the relay, which starts together with the stack on the same address. Nothing to configure: the relay addresses appear in **Settings → TURN for calls** on their own, derived from the installation address, and are only changed if you run your own server.

Open on the firewall:

- 3478/udp and 3478/tcp — the relay itself;
- 49160–49999/udp — the conversation ports (two per call).

Networks that allow nothing but port 443 will not reach the relay on 3478. They need TURN over TLS on 443, which means a separate public address (443 on the main one belongs to the web gateway) or an external TURN service — its addresses go into the same settings.

### External file storage (optional)

By default files are stored in a Docker volume. In **Settings → Storage** the installation can be switched to any S3-compatible storage. Already uploaded files are migrated automatically.

### Updating

When a new release is out, the installation administrator sees a banner in the interface and updates with one button; the same lives in **Settings → Platform → Updates**. The installation updates itself on the server: it downloads the release `compose.yaml`, pulls the images and restarts the services, with about a minute of downtime.

Manually, from the server console: download the new release's `compose.yaml` over the old one and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d --wait
```

Migrations run automatically. Secrets and data stay in their volumes.

## Features

### The AI agent answers customers on its own

Set up in minutes: who it is, how it speaks, what rules it follows. It answers only from your knowledge and does not make things up. If the data is missing, it says so honestly and offers to bring in an employee.

### Smart handoff to a person

When the agent cannot find an answer or the customer asks for a real person, the conversation goes to operators right away with a notification. Every conversation has three modes: AI answers, an employee answers, paused.

### All channels in one window

Telegram, MAX, VK, email and website chat land in a single conversation list. The employee sees where the customer came from and replies in the same channel.

### Knowledge base with semantic search

Articles, categories, file import, attachments. The agent finds what it needs by meaning, not only by matching words. If the provider offers no embeddings, search falls back to full text without losing functionality.

### Public help center

A portal with your articles on your own domain and in your own look. Categories, article revisions, usefulness ratings from readers. The agent answers from the same articles: editing an article changes the bot's answers immediately.

### Website chat in one tag

The widget is installed with a single line of code and runs in an isolated window. Voice messages, files, calls. Allowed domains and abuse protection are configured in the UI.

### Audio and video calls from the chat

The customer and the employee call each other straight from the conversation without third-party services. Works in the web widget, Telegram, MAX and VK. A relay is available for difficult networks.

### Operator workspace

Priorities, colored labels, conversation notes, assignment to an employee, reply templates. Voice messages with on-demand transcription. Files and images. Sound notification on a new message.

### One customer profile

One person from different channels is collected into a single profile. Duplicates are merged manually with a reason and can be reverted. The customer list exports to CSV.

### Team and access

Owner, administrator and employee roles. Invitations by email. Visibility groups: an employee sees the conversations of their groups and those they are responsible for. Two-factor protection with TOTP. A full activity log with filters.

### Employee notifications in messengers

Waiting conversations and new messages reach the employee in Telegram or MAX. Linking is done from the profile with a one-time code.

### Your own server and your own AI model

Installs with one command, data stays with you. Connect any AI model provider with your own key: OpenRouter, an OpenAI-compatible service, a local model.

### Customer data protection

Phone numbers, email addresses and long numeric identifiers are stripped from text before it is sent to the AI model. Integration tokens, SMTP passwords, S3 keys and TOTP secrets are stored encrypted in the database.

## Design System and Frontend

The platform interfaces (`@chatballs/internal-ui`, `@chatballs/web-chat`, and `@chatballs/ui`) are unified under the **Consta UI** design system (`@consta/uikit`, `@consta/icons`).

See:
- [Developer Guide (Consta UI)](docs/design-system/developer-guide.md)
- [Design System Specification](docs/design-system/README.md)
- [`@chatballs/ui` Package Documentation](packages/ui/README.md)
- [ADR: Consta UI Migration](docs/architecture/adr-consta-ui-migration.md)

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>The stack does not start: port 80 or 443 is busy</strong></summary>

The gateway publishes ports 80 and 443. Free them, or bind the gateway to a specific IP with the `CHATBALLS_WEB_LISTENING_IP` variable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The installation opens by IP but not over HTTPS</strong></summary>

This is expected until a domain is set. Enter the domain in **Settings → Platform**. Make sure the domain's DNS record points to the server and ports 80 and 443 are reachable from outside: without that the certificate cannot be issued.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The certificate is not issued after changing the domain</strong></summary>

Certificates are issued on demand, at the first request to the domain. Open the domain in a browser and wait a few seconds. If that does not help, check the gateway log:

```bash
docker compose logs gateway
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The first-run wizard says the setup has already been completed</strong></summary>

The organization already exists. Sign in at the installation address with the owner account. If the password is lost, use email recovery: outgoing mail must be configured for that.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Invitations and emails are not sent</strong></summary>

Check SMTP in **Settings → Platform**. There is a button to send a test email. Typical causes: wrong port, TLS turned off, an app password instead of the account password.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The agent does not answer customers</strong></summary>

Check in order:

1. The agent status is **Active**, not **Draft**.
2. The agent has an AI model provider selected. Without it no answer is possible.
3. The provider in **Integrations** has the **Connected** status. Run the check to refresh it.
4. The conversation is not switched to **Operator** or **Paused** mode.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>An integration shows the Error status</strong></summary>

Open the integration and run the check. For bots the usual cause is a wrong token or an unreachable proxy. For email: wrong IMAP or SMTP parameters. Integration errors also arrive as notifications.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Messages from Telegram, MAX or VK do not arrive</strong></summary>

The background worker polls the bots. Make sure it is running:

```bash
docker compose ps worker
```

```bash
docker compose logs worker
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Calls do not connect</strong></summary>

Between browsers a call goes directly; behind strict NAT and on a VPN it goes through the relay. Check that the `coturn` container runs (`docker compose ps coturn`) and that 3478/udp, 3478/tcp and the 49160–49999/udp range are open on the firewall. The addresses in **Settings → TURN for calls** must not be empty: they are derived from the installation address, so that address has to be set first.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrations fail with "must be owner of table"</strong></summary>

Schema objects belong to another role. Normalize ownership and rerun the migrations:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U chatballs_bootstrap -d chatballs -f /chatballs-reassign-ownership.sql
```

```bash
docker compose run --rm init
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Files do not upload or open</strong></summary>

With local storage, files live in the `chatballs-media` volume. Check free disk space. With S3, open **Settings → Storage**: it shows the last connection error and the migration status.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The widget does not appear on the site</strong></summary>

Check that the widget status is **Published** and the site's domain is in the allowed list. The key in the `data-widget-key` attribute must match the key from the widget settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to check that everything works</strong></summary>

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All services should be `healthy` or `running`. Application readiness is available at `/api/v1/health/ready/`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do not delete the secrets volume</strong></summary>

The `chatballs-secrets` volume holds the encryption key. Without it, integration tokens, SMTP passwords, S3 keys and two-factor secrets become unreadable. The `chatballs-secrets-platform` and `chatballs-secrets-schema` volumes hold the database role passwords: without them the stack cannot connect to its own database. Include all three volumes in backups together with the database and files.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Backup</strong></summary>

Copy the `chatballs-postgres`, `chatballs-media`, `chatballs-secrets`, `chatballs-secrets-platform` and `chatballs-secrets-schema` volumes. A database dump can be taken as well:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U chatballs_bootstrap chatballs > backup.sql
```
</details>
